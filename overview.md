### Check [Browser](browser.html) Requirements

Your browser must support Web Serial. That means Chrome or Edge.

### Check [PC](pc.html) Requirements

You need a PC (Windows, Mac, Linux) with a USB port to run the browser.

### Check [USB Serial Drivers](drivers.html)

Linux has all required drivers by default. Windows and Mac may require driver installation.

### [Identify](identify.html) Your MCU Chip and Board

To install MicroPython on your MCU board, identify the specific board you have.
If you’re unsure of the exact model, you can alternatively install
MicroPython for a generic board, provided you know the RAM and Flash size.
Additionally, you’ll need to know the MCU chip (ESP32, ESP32-C3, ESP32-S3)
used on your board.

### [Connect](connect.html) Your MCU

Use an appropriate USB cable to connect your MCU to your PC.

### Enter [Download Mode](download.html)

Some MCUs require a special sequence of button presses to put them into download mode.
