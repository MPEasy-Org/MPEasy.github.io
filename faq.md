Q: Why not support `.uf2` format downloads?
ESP32 boards lack the hardware to support this format.
Many newer boards with the necessary hardware arrive
without a UF2 bootloader installed in flash.
It's at least as hard to get the right UF2 bootloader installed
as it is to just install MicroPython from a `.bin` file.
